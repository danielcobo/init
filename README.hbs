## 🚀 Quickstart

### Install

```cli
npm install -g {{repo.name}}
```

<sub>**Note:** In case you're wondering, **@danielcobo/** is just a [namespace scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes/) - an NPM feature. Scopes make it easier to name modules and improve [security](https://github.blog/2021-02-12-avoiding-npm-substitution-attacks/).</sub>

### Example use

In the terminal run:

```cli
init
```

Follow the prompts to set up the package.

That's it. Go build something amazing 😄.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you run into trouble or have questions just [submit an issue]({{nogit repo.repository.url}}/issues).

## 🤝 Contributing

### Anyone can contribute

Contributions come in many shapes and sizes. All are welcome.

- sharing this repo with friends
- improving documentation (even fixing typos counts 😉)
- providing tutorials (if you do, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/danielcobocom), I would love to read them)
- improving tests
- contributing code (new features, performance boosts, code readability improvements..)

### Rules for contributions

**General guidelines:**

- there are no dumb questions
- be polite and respectful to others
- do good

**When coding remember:**

- working > maintainability > performance
- best code is no code
- be descriptive when naming
- keep it [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- do test

**Contribution licence:**
All contributions are considered to be under same [license](#license) as this repository.

## 🧪 Testing

**Testing suite:** [🃏 Jest](https://jestjs.io) | **Test command:** `npm test`

**Mutation testing suite:** [👽 Stryker Mutator](https://stryker-mutator.io) | **Mutation test command:** `npm run mutation`

If you intend to develop further or contribute code, then please ensure to write and use testing. Strive for 100% code coverage and high mutation scores. Mutation score 100 is great, but it's not always neccessary (if there are valid reasons).
